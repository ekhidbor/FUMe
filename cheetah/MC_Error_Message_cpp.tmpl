  This is an automatically generated file. Changes to this file
  should instead either be made in a separate file or to the
  data element CSV file used to generate this file

  This file was mechanically generated by running the mcstatus.csv file,
  containing a comma-delimited file of all status codes through the
  "gen_header.py" python script, which uses a cheetah template to mechanically
  format a valid C header. The status codes were obtained by running an original
  mcstatus.h through doxygen to obtain enum names and values. The descriptive
  text is an original work produced from reading public documentation on the API.

  This file is packaged as a part of the FUMe project.
