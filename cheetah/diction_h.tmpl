/**
  This is an automatically generated file. Changes to this file
  should instead either be made in a separate file or to the
  data element CSV file used to generate this file

  This file was mechanically generated by running the DocBook version
  of PS3.6 and PS3.7 through the "docbook_to_table.xslt" transform,
  obtaining a comma-delimited file of all data elements in those
  parts of the standard. The header file itself was generated by
  mechanically translating the comma-delimited file of all data
  elements through the "gen_header.py" python script, which uses
  a cheetah template to mechanically format a valid C header. Aside
  from being a mechanical translation of the DICOM standard, this header
  does not depend on and is not derived from any other files

  This file is packaged as a part of the FUMe project.

  To the extent possible under law, the person who associated CC0 with
  FUMe has waived all copyright and related or neighboring rights
