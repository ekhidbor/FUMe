<!-- This XSLT file outputs an XML version of the Macro Attributes
     tables from the DocBook version of the DICOM standard, PS3.3. The
     syntax of the tables in the standard is surprisingly complicated, as
     macros can "include" other macros, and there is a syntax for indicating
     when data elements are "children" of sequence elements in the macros. 
     The "child element" syntax, implemented with "greater-than" characters,
     would be difficult (for me) to implement in XSLT. So for now we just
     use the XSLT to generate an "indentation level" within the macro
     definition. A subsequent python script will read in this XML file
     and generate the hierarchy

     NOTE: This script may be fragile the way it determines "include" directives
     and determines what is a macro table. But this is the most machine-readable
     for the standard is in, so this is what we're using. It was developed
     against the 2016d version of the standard -->
